## 📚 Assignment Overview

**Jetpack Compose Lab Assignment 1**  
This project is a hands-on exercise to solidify my understanding of Jetpack Compose, Android’s modern UI toolkit.

---

## 📝 Description

This Android application displays a list of academic courses using Jetpack Compose.  
Each course card shows the course title, code, and credit hours.  
Users can tap to expand a card and view a detailed description and prerequisites.

**Key Jetpack Compose concepts demonstrated:**
- **Composable functions:** All UI is built with `@Composable` functions (no XML layouts).
- **State management:** Each card manages its own expand/collapse state using `rememberSaveable`.
- **Efficient lists:** Uses `LazyColumn` for performant, scrollable lists.
- **Animations:** Smooth expand/collapse transitions with `animateContentSize`.
- **Material 3 theming:** Consistent styling using Material 3, with support for both light and dark mode.
- **Theming:** Uses `CourseCatalogTheme` and `MaterialTheme.colorScheme` for adaptive colors.
